**Author:** Maria Andreina Sisco  
**Platform:** Tableau Desktop  
**Date Completed:** July 2025

## Project Overview

This project delivers an interactive **Tableau dashboard** exploring trends in U.S. flight delays and cancellations. The visualization was built using flight data to identify patterns across airlines, airports, time of year, and delay types.

The final dashboard was designed for both dynamic interactivity and static presentation. A fully functional `.twbx` Tableau workbook enables deep exploration of the dataset, while a simplified PowerPoint version was created for presentation purposes.
